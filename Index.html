                <li><span>Brief Info:</span> This powerful predator roams the Amiracas, where it is also called panther, puma, catamount or mountain lion. Cougars like to prey on dear, though they also eat smaller animals such as coyotes, and raccoons. They usually hunt at night or during the gloaming hours of dawn or dusk.
                <p>Cougers are mostly related to domestic cats than they are to the other "large cats" of the world (i.e, tigers, lions, and Jaguars), as they cannot roar and often communicate with chirps, hisses and growls</p></li>
